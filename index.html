            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Saber became a known figure in his country, Iran, after he ranked first in the University entrance exam in 2017 among more than 140,0000 highschool students. He chose to pursue Computer Science as his Undergraduate major in Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. Closer to the end of his undergraduate studies, Saber gradually developed interest in Operations Research when he was trying to solve an NP-hard scheduling problem with a bunch of metaheuristics. This was the beginning of his transition to the OR side. Now he is a second year PhD student in the Computational and Applied mathematics and Operations Research Department at Rice University. He is under supervision of <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/illya-v-hicks" target="_blank">Prof. Illya V. Hicks</a> and is working on a problem named Graph Coupling. </p>
